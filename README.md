# GunnerModPC

## Features
- Adds the T-34-85 to the Grafenwoehr tank range.
- Adds back the live hitlog.
- Adds back the FPS counter in the bottom left corner.
- Removes the 3rd person crosshair.
- Patches the map selector dropdown so you don't have to scroll for the bottom few maps.
- Adds the target cheese to the Grafenwoehr tank range.

## Building
You can simply build the project with Visual Studio, but first you have to fix the references so that they point to your game DLLs.
